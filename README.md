# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this code you will find ways to create query using sqlalchemy, filtering data by dates and particular values. The data is organized in particular orders and evaluations(max,min,avg) over a particular time period on a particular item. Histograms and bar charts are created to display results. 
In addition you will find code that will display data results using Flask to create different App routes. Again each route will display results based off of items, orders, and date filtering tools.
